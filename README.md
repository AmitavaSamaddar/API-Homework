Observations on data -

1.  We have more cities in northern hemisphere than southern hemisphere.
2.  There are cities closer to pole in northern hemisphere than southern hemisphere (south pole is actually covered by Antarctic ocean, which makes sense).
3.  Latidute vs. Max Temp plot - Currently (early January) it is winter in northern hemisphere and summer in southern.  So, in the plot we are seeing negative max temp in high north latitudes and all cities are above 40 F in southern hemisphere.  However, cities close to equator (having low latitude value, positive or negative) are quite warm.
4.  Latitude vs. humidity plot - not able to make any conclusion based on the latitude and the data are quite similarly present for positive and negative latitudes (north and south).  However, most of the cities are having 60% or more humidity
5.  Latitude vs. cloudiness plot - not able to make any conclusion based on latitude as data is quite scattered.  However, the plot showswe there are concentration of cities with absolutely no cloud and lots of cloud.
6.  Latitude vs. wind speed plot - most of the cities are having windspeed less than 10 mph at this time.  Highest wind speed for any cities in the data is just above 35 mph, which means we are not observing any high wind/storm in these cities.  Though higher wind speed (>25 mph) are mostly in northern hemishpere at this time.
